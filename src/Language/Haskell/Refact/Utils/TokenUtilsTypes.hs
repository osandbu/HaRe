{-

Structure is to be indexed by SrcSpan.

Memo-ised.

Must be recursive, so if one srcspan is requested that contains a
modified sub-src span, the modified one is returned.

When initialising, split the tokens according to the binds, including
the leading and following comments. And perhaps a preamble and
postamble.

The token start and end loc does not necessarily coincide with the
associated srcloc, due to leading / trailing comments

SrcSpans are nested in one another according to the structure of the
AST.

Store it in some kind of tree structure, memoised.

Invariants:
  1. For each tree, either the rootLabel has a SrcSpan only, or the subForest /= [].
  2. The trees making up the subForest of a given node fully include the parent SrcSpan.
     i.e. the leaves contain all the tokens for a given SrcSpan.
  3. A given SrcSpan can only appear (or be included) in a single tree of the forest.
