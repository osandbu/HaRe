module Demote.PatBindIn1 where

--A definition can be demoted to the local 'where' binding of a friend declaration,
--if it is only used by this friend declaration.

--Demoting a definition narrows down the scope of the definition.
--In this example, demote the top level 'tup' to 'foo'
--This example aims to test demoting pattern binding.
